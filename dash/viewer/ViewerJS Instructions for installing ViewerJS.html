<h3 id="how-to-use-viewerjs">How to use ViewerJS</h3>
<p>Putting ViewerJS on your website is pretty easy, and shouldn't take more than five minutes.
ViewerJS is a pretty versatile document viewer that resides on your web server itself. </p>
<p>Running ViewerJS is as simple as making a link. You can use it to give a full screen
presentation, but also for showing documents inline in your website or as a
viewer for links to documents. Because of the way your browser protects itself
against security risks (which is a very good thing) ViewerJS only works on
documents that reside on your own server. ViewerJS is complete and 
self-contained - it does not rely on other services.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>For using ViewerJS you don't have to change the page you want to add
the document to - activating the viewer pretty much works like making
a regular link. Normally when you create a link to a document on your 
site you would use:</p>
<div class="panel">
<strong>&lt;a href="/path/to/filename.ext"&gt;</strong>
</div>

<p>For initiating ViewerJS we point the browser to the viewer which (if you followed the instructions)
resides at <em>/ViewerJS/index.html</em>. We only need to write down <em>/ViewerJS/</em>, the browser will understand the rest.
The next thing we need to do is tell the browser the location of the actual file we want to show. </p>
<p>We tell ViewerJS where it can find the document by giving the regular <em>path/to/filename.ext</em> (that is: the absolute path of
the document counted from the 'root directory' of your webiste) like so:</p>
<p>In practical terms that means we indicate to the browser to go back to the top folder with #..
(if you put the directory with ViewerJS elsewhere,  </p>
<div class="panel">
<strong>&lt;a href="/ViewerJS/#../path/to/filename.ext"&gt;</strong>
</div>

<p>(Since we are already using the regular path in the browser for pointing it to the folder with ViewerJS, we
use a relative link back from that location preceded by the <strong>#</strong> character.) </p>
<p>That is it. In principle you don't need to change anything to the 'host' page.
Of course you often want to use ViewerJS for embedding a document inside a
page. For that we will use a so called iframe - really just a page within a web
page. Check out the <a href="http://viewerjs.org/examples">examples</a>, and just open the source of the 
webpage to see how it works.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<p>Here are the basic steps that are necessary to put ViewerJS on your website.</p>
<ol>
<li>Everything starts with <a href="http://viewerjs.org/releases/ViewerJS-latest.zip">downloading ViewerJS</a> from 
the website.</li>
<li>Unpack the file on your computer. This will give you a folder called
'ViewerJS'. Upload that folder to your webserver, preferably to the top
folder. Now you are ready to see ViewerJS in action.</li>
<li>Upload a document to your webserver (for the demo we'll use a PDF, if you
don't have one <a href="http://viewerjs.org/demodoc.pdf">use this</a>. If you already have documents on
there, you can skip this step.</li>
<li>See if the document is where you think it is, by inserting the address in
the address bar of your browser. If your browser offers to download the
document, you are set. If not, check if you have the correct location of the
file.</li>
<li>Create the link to the document as you normally would do (that link can be
anywhere, as long as both ViewerJS and the document you want to link to are
on the same website). Now comes the tricky part: we have to use the syntax
described above to point to the document.</li>
</ol>
<div class="panel">
<strong>&lt;a href="/ViewerJS/#../path/to/filename.ext"&gt;</strong>
</div>

<p>(If you want, you can always try to see if ViewerJS is installed 
correctly by going to the address bar of the browser, and inserting <strong>/ViewerJS/#..</strong> inbetween the domain name part of your website (below it is example.org) and the rest of the path:</p>
<div class="panel">
<strong>&lt;a href="<em>http://</em>example.org/ViewerJS/#../path/to/filename.ext"&gt;</strong>
</div>

<p>If that works, you can just copy that URI as well.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-in-a-page">Embedding in a page</h2>
<p>To embed a document in the same way as you see here:</p>
<iframe src="ViewerJS%20Instructions%20for%20installing%20ViewerJS_files/a.html" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="600" height="450"></iframe>

<p>we need to draw an iframe and then pass the same link as we had before to it.
So if we have a document in folder <strong>/demo/ohm2013.odp</strong> it will look something like this:</p>
<div class="panel">
&lt;iframe src = "/ViewerJS/#../demo/ohm2013.odp"
width='<strong>400</strong>' height='<strong>300</strong>' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</div>

<p>Note that you need to set the width and the height of the iframe in your page.
ViewerJS will try to use all the space you give it, but if you want to make
optimal use of your screen estate make sure that you fit the window of ViewerJS 
to the dimensions of the document you want to show. If you don't know what to do,
just try it out with some different formats.</p>
<p>Common formats:</p>
<p><strong>(A4 sized documents - portrait)</strong> (1.414 : 1)</p>
<ul>
<li>width='724' height='1024' </li>
<li>width='566' height='800' </li>
<li>width='389' height='550' </li>
<li>width='297' height='210'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(A4 sized documents - landscape)</strong> (1 : 1.414 )</p>
<ul>
<li>width='1024' height='724' </li>
<li>width='800' height='566' </li>
<li>width='550' height='389' </li>
<li>width='210' height='297'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(screen sized documents)</strong> (4 : 3)</p>
<ul>
<li>width='1024' height='768' </li>
<li>width='800' height='600' </li>
<li>width='600' height='450'</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to position the document to the left or right, use <strong>style="float:left;"</strong> or <strong>style="float:right;"</strong>.
If you want to center the document, use <strong>style="text-align:center;"</strong>:</p>
<div class="panel">
&lt;iframe style="float:right;" src = "/ViewerJS/#../demo/ohm2013.odp"
width='<strong>400</strong>' height='<strong>300</strong>' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</div>

<h2>What is ViewerJS?</h2>

<p>ViewerJS is a combination of a number of excellent open source tools 
that are built on HTML and JavaScript. ViewerJS was funded by NLnet 
foundation, consider a <a href="http://nlnet.nl/donating">donation</a>.</p>

<p>The heavy lifting in ViewerJS is done by these awesome projects:</p>

<h2>PDF.js (by Mozilla)</h2>
<img style="float: right;" src="ViewerJS%20Instructions%20for%20installing%20ViewerJS_files/pdfjs.png" alt="PDF.js logo">
<p>PDF.js is a library created by Andreas Gal and others at Mozilla 
Labs. It is an HTML5 technology experiment that explores building a 
faithful and efficient Portable Document Format (PDF) renderer without 
native code assistance.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by <a href="http://labs.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Labs</a>.
 Its goal is to create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform 
for parsing and rendering PDFs, and eventually release a PDF reader 
extension powered by PDF.js.

<h2>WebODF (by KO GmbH)</h2>
<img style="float: right;" src="ViewerJS%20Instructions%20for%20installing%20ViewerJS_files/webodf.png" alt="WebODF logo">
<p>WebODF is a JavaScript library that shows office documents created by <a href="http://kogmbh.com/">KO GmbH</a>.
 It was started by Jos van den Oever at KO and is now developed by a 
growing team including external collaborators. It makes it easy to add 
Open Document Format (ODF) support to your website and to your mobile or
 desktop applications. It uses HTML and CSS to display ODF documents.
